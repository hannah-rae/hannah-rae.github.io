I am currently an Assistant Professor in the School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence at Arizona State University. My research focuses on developing machine learning systems for real-world data and use cases. This includes remote sensing and spatial datasets, fairness (particularly w.r.t. geographic bias), scientific discovery and exploration, agriculture and food security, and other topics. I am the AI/Machine Learning Lead for [NASA Harvest](https://nasaharvest.org/) and [NASA Acres](https://www.nasaacres.org/) as well as Center Faculty for the ASU Center for Global Discovery and Conservation Science ([GDCS](https://gdcs.asu.edu/)). I was recognized on the [Forbes 30 Under 30](https://www.forbes.com/profile/hannah-kerner/?sh=66d9f317624f) list in Science in 2021. I also write and speak about challenges for developing AI/ML applications for real world problems, such as in [this recent article in MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/08/18/1007196/ai-research-machine-learning-applications-problems-opinion/).

Prior to joining the faculty at ASU, I was an Assistant Research Professor at the University of Maryland, College Park. I did my Ph.D. at Arizona State University on machine learning methods (especially novelty detection) for planetary exploration missions. I received my B.S. in computer science from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where I conducted research on 3D motion planning for autonomous agents. I have worked at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Goddard Space Flight Center, and Langley Research Center, as well as the commercial remote sensing company Planet, Inc. I am passionate about advancing opportunities for people who have traditionally been underrepresented in or excluded from computer science and devote much of my time outside of research to these efforts.
